> [!IMPORTANT]\
> To aid in its speed of development, `lc-hax` has no concept of versioning aside from the Git commit history. We make no guarantees for any kind of backward compatiblity. Any feature can be removed or heavily modified to maximise user experience and overwrite poor early decisions.

### TriggerMod

`TriggerMod` is a quality-of-life mod that allows you to trigger various objects in the game. It is activated by pointing at objects with `M3`. Currently, it can do the following.

- Explode landmines
- Explode unequipped jetpacks
- Trigger turrets
- Toggle gates
- Unlock doors
- Trigger Jeb's attack
- Lure enemies to player
- Follow a player's movements
- Interact with objects from far
- Possess enemies (only in `Phantom`)

### Build

The arguments for the `build` command can be executed with either the unlockable index or name. The list of unlockables can be found in the following table.

> [!NOTE]\
> Unintuitively, not all unlockables are buildable. Thus, the `build` command also doubles as a pseudo unlock function for unlockables.

| ID | Name               |
|--- |--------------------|
| 0  | ORANGE_SUIT        |
| 1  | GREEN_SUIT         |
| 2  | HAZARD_SUIT        |
| 3  | PAJAMA_SUIT        |
| 4  | COZY_LIGHTS        |
| 5  | TELEPORTER         |
| 6  | TELEVISION         |
| 7  | CUPBOARD           |
| 8  | FILE_CABINET       |
| 9  | TOILET             |
| 10 | SHOWER             |
| 11 | LIGHT_SWITCH       |
| 12 | RECORD_PLAYER      |
| 13 | TABLE              |
| 14 | ROMANTIC_TABLE     |
| 15 | BUNKBEDS           |
| 16 | TERMINAL           |
| 17 | SIGNAL_TRANSMITTER |
| 18 | LOUD_HORN          |
| 19 | INVERSE_TELEPORTER |
| 20 | JACK_O_LANTERN     |
| 21 | WELCOME_MAT        |
| 22 | GOLDFISH           |
| 23 | PLUSHIE_PAJAMA_MAN |

### Disabling Mods

You may permanently disable mods by removing the corresponding `Mod` class under the `LoadHaxModules` function from the following [file](lc-hax/Scripts/Loader.cs). In the following example, we disable `StaminaMod` and you will return to the game's default stamina mechanics in your next injection.

```cs
static void LoadHaxModules() {
    DontDestroyOnLoad(Loader.HaxModules);

    Loader.AddHaxModules<SaneMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ChatMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<StunMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ShovelMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<WeightMod>();
    // Loader.AddHaxModules<StaminaMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<PhantomMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<TriggerMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ClearVisionMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<NameInWeightMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<BuildAnywhereMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<FollowAnotherPlayerMod>();
}
```

## Whitelisting SharpMonoInjectorCore

Despite being compiled from source locally, SharpMonoInjector is occasionally falsely identified as a virus by Windows Defender. If you believe you know what you are doing, you can run the following command in PowerShell with administrator privileges to whitelist the injector.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Do ensure that you are currently in the `lc-hax` directory before executing the command.

```ps1
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $pwd, "$env:TEMP\.net\SharpMonoInjector"
```
