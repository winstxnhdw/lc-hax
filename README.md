> [!IMPORTANT]\

### TriggerMod

`TriggerMod` is a quality-of-life mod that allows you to trigger various objects in the game. It is activated by pointing at objects with `M3`. Currently, it can do the following.

- Explode landmines
- Explode unequipped jetpacks
- Trigger turrets
- Toggle gates
- Unlock doors
- Trigger Jeb's attack
- Lure enemies to player
- Follow a player's movements
- Interact with objects from far
- Possess enemies (only in `Phantom`)

### Fatality

The `fatality` command allows you to kill a player with a custom animation. The list of supported enemies are:

- Forest Giant
- Jester
- Masked
- Baboon Hawk
- Circuit Bee
- Thumper
- Eyeless Dog
- Bracken
- Nutcracker

### Build

The arguments for the `build` command can be executed with either the unlockable index or name. The list of unlockables can be found in the following.

> [!NOTE]\
> Unintuitively, not all unlockables are buildable. Thus, the `build` command also doubles as a pseudo unlock function for unlockables.

- Orange Suit
- Green Suit
- Hazard Suit
- Pajama Suit
- Cozy Lights
- Teleporter
- Television
- Cupboard
- File Cabinet
- Toilet
- Shower
- Light Switch
- Record Player
- Table
- Romantic Table
- Bunkbeds
- Terminal
- Signal Transmitter
- Loud Horn
- Inverse Teleporter
- Jack O' Lantern
- Welcome Mat
- Goldfish
- Plushie Pajama Man
- Purple Suit

### Disabling Mods

You may permanently disable mods by removing the corresponding `Mod` class under the `LoadHaxModules` function from the following [file](lc-hax/Scripts/Loader.cs). In the following example, we disable `StaminaMod` and you will return to the game's default stamina mechanic in your next injection.

```cs
static void LoadHaxModules() {
    DontDestroyOnLoad(Loader.HaxModules);

    Loader.AddHaxModules<SaneMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ChatMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<StunMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ShovelMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<WeightMod>();
    // Loader.AddHaxModules<StaminaMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<PhantomMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<TriggerMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<ClearVisionMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<NameInWeightMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<BuildAnywhereMod>();
    Loader.AddHaxModules<FollowAnotherPlayerMod>();
}
```

### Disabling Patches

There is usually little reason for you to disable patches as they are carefully chosen and come with sane defaults. However, if for whatever reason you wish to disable a patch, you may freely delete any of the corresponding files based on their names [here](lc-hax/Scripts/Patches).

## Whitelisting SharpMonoInjectorCore

Despite being compiled from source locally, SharpMonoInjector is occasionally falsely identified as a virus by Windows Defender. If you believe you know what you are doing, you can run the following command in PowerShell with administrator privileges to whitelist the injector.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Do ensure that you are currently in the `lc-hax` directory before executing the command.

```ps1
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $pwd, "$env:TEMP\.net\SharpMonoInjector"
```

## Alternatives

If `lc-hax` is not your fancy, here are excellent alternatives that may suit your needs!

### Project Apparatus

[Project Apparatus](https://github.com/KaylinOwO/Project-Apparatus) is a popular GUI-first internal cheat based on Infinite Company.

### Lethal Menu

[Lethal Menu](https://github.com/IcyRelic/LethalMenu) is a powerful GUI-first internal cheat based on `Project Apparatus` and `lc-hax`. It supports chams, super speed, fast climbing and more.
